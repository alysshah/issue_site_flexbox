      <div class="intro">
        <p>Historically, Anti-Asian violence has always been present within the US, starting with the racist ideology behind the Yellow Peril (late 19th century); however, the spread of COVID-19 has multiplied the occurence of these already existing threats, and, since the virus’ arrival in the US, cases of violence and harassment fueled by xenophobia towards the AAPI (Asian-American and Pacific Islander) community were multiplied.</p>

        <p>This Anti-Asian sentiment continues to result in horrific hate crimes, many of them deadly. Today, a significant amount of incidents are reported in (but are far from limited to) the Bay Area and Chinatowns across the nation, especially the ones in Oakland and San Fransisco (which are some of the largest in the world). The NYPD reported in 2020 that the number of hate crimes had increased by nearly 1900% in NYC since the start of the pandemic, and, according to the Stop AAPI Hate coalition, around 7.3% of cases (from a pool of 2,808 reported across most of the US, also during the pandemic) were targeted towards Asian-Americans older than 60. Unfortunately, knowing that many cases go unreported or are ignored means that the situation is even worse than the numbers let on. Some of the more widely-recognized cases included those of Vicha Ratanapakdee (84), who died after being knocked to the ground by a teenager; Noel Quintana (61), whose face was slashed open on an NYC subway; Mauricio Gesmundo Sr. (83), who was beaten up and robbed on NYE; an 89-year-old woman who was set on fire; and many more. It’s also important to mention the case of Vincent Chin, despite it not being as recent: in 1982, the Chinese-American man was brutally murdered in Detroit while celebrating his upcoming wedding after being mistook for being Japanese. While his death didn’t make national news in itself, the shockingly light sentencing of his killers led to outrage; this helped mark a turning point for the AAPI community as it helped spark protests and led to a movement in activism for Asian-American rights.

      <p>Since being elected, President Biden has developed and released an agenda for the AAPI community.  His campaign reads that “As president, Joe will continue his lifelong commitment to ensure that every member of the AAPI community is treated with dignity—no matter their race or ethnicity—and has a fair shot at the American Dream.” Vice-President Kamala Harris, too, has made it very clear where she stands, taking to twitter to talk about the efforts the Administration will be making and to state that “We must continue to commit ourselves to combating racism and discrimination.”</p>
      <p>Many Asian Americans are not being given voices in mainstream media and are therefore incapable of communicating their stories, needs, and struggles. Many of these cases of extreme violence are not being talked about enough or are not circulating in the press. Many members of the AAPI community have stood up and addressed these violent attacks, including celebrities such as Daniel Day Kim and Daniel Wu, but the rest of the US hasn’t always been as quick in reacting. Now more than ever, it’s crucial to practice allyship and show one’s support for the AAPI community by amplifying Asian-American voices, volunteering or donating if possible, reporting incidents if any are witnessed, and staying informed and educated.</p>
